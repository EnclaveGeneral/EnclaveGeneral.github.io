    <h1>Project Proposal Description</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Motivation: I want to be able to solve a recurring issue at my parent's house, the issue involves lots of random animals,
        who just come wandering in the yard and hopping our fences at night. This problem is especially potent with coyotes,
        who not only comes but also pee (disgusting) and howl like there is no tomorrow! So, I want to build a small machine utilizing
        the LED light, that turns on at night and is able to deter those animals so they do not go into our yard and harrass us!
      </p>
      <p> This represents my rough sketch of my plan </p>
      <img src="final_plan.png" alt="circuit schematic" width = "720" height = "480"/>
      <p> Here are other additional information:
        <ul>
          <li>Anticipated Bill Of Materials?
            <br/>
            LED Strip (For Lighting)
            Motion Sensor
            Button
            Wiring
            Arduino and Computation Software

          </li>
          <li>What are the functionalities you want it to have?
            <br/>
            I would like the button to be able to turn on/off the led light strip on demand as needed
            Also, I would like the led strip to be turned on by the autonomous motion sensor to anticipate
            if an animal approach, the LED light would turn on and scare them off.
          </li>
          <li>Timeline
            <br/>
              First, I need to get the motion sensor working, last week, i got the LED working correctly with
              the arudino and the transistor, so i need to get the motion sensor working so that it controls when
              LED turns on and off.

              Of course, if this does not work well, I do have another plan which involves other actions with lights,
              probably decorating my desk or some other things with LED light.

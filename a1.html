      <p> Here is the code for this project with commenting! </p>
      <p> Here are some additional Questions: 
        <ul>
          <li>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? 
            <br/>
            I could get all three to blink independently, as they each had their very own 
            individual input pins. 
          </li>
          <li>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs to no longer tell? 
            <br/>
            I would say probably like under 50 or 25 miliseconds, the eye simply 
            cannot discern most differences at that speed or interval. 
          </li>
          <li>Do you use AI tools to help you with this assignment?
            <br/>
            Oh, I absolutely did, but what I did was simply searching up the right 
            HTML tags and their syntax just to make sure what I had was correct. 
          </li>
        </ul>
